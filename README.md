# Conversations

**Rails 4.2.6**

***Twitter*** has a couple of glaring issues that effect user experience.  

*    Users experience varies dramatically if one is using an app, a mobile browser, or a web browser.
*    The tweets on one's timeline can be vastly different from followed user's timeline.
*     A wealth of information is not viewable on a timeline when a followed user engages in a conversation.   


As shown from these screen caps:

it's clear that the user experience differs between devices.  As a Rails Dev who follows other devs for relevant and current information about what's going on in the field I found this to be an issue in how I want to use Twitter and decided to create my own stream curation.
